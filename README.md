# EUCAIM Substra FL demonstrator

This repository is the Substra implementation of the EUCAIM FL demonstrator. It implements the two different experiments specified in the [fl_demonstrator repo](https://github.com/EUCAIM/fl_demonstrator).

This repo contains two demonstrations:

- `demo_dl`, for Deep Learning
- `demo_ml`, for Machine Learning

Each demo has its own folder and is fully independant. Each demo has also its own `README.md` inside the folder.
